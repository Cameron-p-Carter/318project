Current Implementation Overview

  The healthcare platform project has been successfully structured as a Maven multi-module Spring Boot application with Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.2.0. The project follows microservices architecture with four distinct
  bounded contexts, though currently two services have been fully implemented while two remain pending. The infrastructure includes all required dependencies including Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 database, Spring
  Cloud Stream for Kafka integration, and LangChain4j for AI functionality.

  Appointment Scheduling Service - Cameron's Implementation

  Cameron has implemented the appointment service following domain-driven design principles with a comprehensive domain model. The service centers around two main aggregate roots - Patient and Appointment entities -       
  both extending Spring's AbstractAggregateRoot to enable domain event publishing. The Patient entity handles registration with auto-generated medical record numbers and maintains relationships with appointments, while    
   the Appointment entity manages the complete lifecycle from scheduling through completion or cancellation. The domain events system captures all state changes including PatientRegisteredEvent,
  AppointmentScheduledEvent, AppointmentRescheduledEvent, AppointmentCancelledEvent, and AppointmentCompletedEvent. The service uses proper enumeration types for AppointmentStatus and AppointmentType, providing type       
  safety and clear business logic separation. The layered architecture includes separate directories for controllers, services, domain models, and infrastructure components, following Spring Boot best practices.

  Financial Management Service - James's Implementation

  James has created the financial service with a unique interactive command-line interface that provides immediate user interaction upon service startup. The service manages Invoice entities that link to appointments      
  through appointmentId references and track patient billing information, insurance claims, and payment status. The implementation includes a DataInitializer component that pre-populates the H2 database with sample        
  invoice data for immediate testing and demonstration. The CLI menu system allows users to view all invoices, claim insurance for specific invoices, and mark invoices as paid, with each operation providing immediate      
  feedback. The service implements event-driven architecture through FinancialEventPublisher and FinancialEventListener components that handle inter-service communication. The invoice entity includes comprehensive
  fields for appointmentId, patientId, patientName, amount using BigDecimal for financial precision, insurance claim status, and payment status tracking.

  Project Infrastructure and Configuration

  The parent project structure uses Maven's multi-module approach with centralized dependency management for Spring Cloud, LangChain4j, and other shared components. Each service runs on dedicated ports with the
  appointment service on 8081 and financial service on 8084, each maintaining separate H2 database instances accessible through individual H2 console interfaces. The configuration includes Kafka integration setup for      
  event streaming between services, though the actual Kafka topics and message handling are prepared but not yet fully activated. Environment variable support is configured for the Gemini API key required for
  LangChain4j AI functionality, with proper fallback handling for development environments.


  Remaining Implementation Requirements

  Two major services remain to be implemented to complete the four-service architecture requirement. The Medication Management Service needs to handle drug orders, prescription refills, medication administration
  tracking, and lab testing integration with AI-powered drug interaction checking. The Medical Records Service must manage comprehensive patient history, diagnosis tracking, and treatment plan management with
  appropriate domain events and inter-service communication. Additionally, the existing services require completion of their REST API controllers for external access, full Kafka event streaming implementation between      
  services, and integration of LangChain4j AI agents for the required agentic AI components that demonstrate intelligent healthcare automation.

  Architectural Foundation Success

  The implemented services successfully demonstrate the core patterns required for the project including domain-driven design with aggregate roots, event sourcing through domain events, layered architecture separation,    
   and microservice independence with dedicated databases. The Spring Boot configuration properly implements the mandatory technology stack requirements, and the Maven structure supports the multi-service development      
  approach needed for the remaining implementation phases.
