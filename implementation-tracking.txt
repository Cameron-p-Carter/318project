NEW TEMPLATE PROJECTS ANALYSIS
===============================================================================

### Cargo Tracker (cargo-tracker-0.1-main)
Purpose: Demonstrates complete microservices with DDD, Kafka events, REST APIs

Key Lessons:
- Four microservices: Booking MS, Routing MS, Tracking MS, Handling MS
- Complete REST API implementations with curl examples
- Domain model with entities, value objects, aggregates
- Command pattern for CQRS architecture
- Kafka event streaming between services
- Proper bounded context separation

What We Can Copy:
- REST controller structure
- Kafka event publishing patterns
- Inter-service communication via events
- Domain service patterns
- Repository patterns

### Cargo Tracker Stream Processing (cargo-tracker-0.1-stream-processing)
Purpose: Adds Analytics MS with stream processing and interactive queries

Key Lessons:
- StreamProcessor.java: Defines stream processing topology
- 30-second tumbling window for real-time aggregation
- Interactive queries on windowed data
- REST API to query stream processing results
- Demo client that sends continuous requests

What We Need to Implement:
- Analytics/Stream Processing service for our platform
- Tumbling window queries (e.g., appointments per hour, medication orders by type)
- Interactive query REST endpoints
- This satisfies "2 real-time analysis use cases" requirement

### Customer Support Agent (customer-support-agent-main)
Already analyzed - shows LangChain4j AI agent patterns

### Rest Services with Spring (rest-services-with-spring-v4-master)
Already analyzed - shows microservice communication patterns

WHAT'S LEFT TO DO - MINIMUM FOR FULL MARKS
===============================================================================

## CRITICAL PATH (Must Have)

### 1. Complete Medication Service
Components Needed:
- Domain: Medication, Prescription entities
- Repository layer
- Service layer with business logic
- REST Controller
- Domain events (MedicationOrdered, PrescriptionRefilled)
- Kafka event publishing

Why Simple is OK:
- Just need basic CRUD operations
- Event publishing to demonstrate event-driven architecture
- Link to appointment completion events

### 2. Complete Medical Records Service
Components Needed:
- Domain: MedicalRecord, Diagnosis, TreatmentPlan entities
- Repository layer
- Service layer
- REST Controller
- Domain events (RecordCreated, DiagnosisAdded)
- Event consumption from Appointment/Medication services

Why Simple is OK:
- Just stores records linked to patients
- Listens to appointment completion events
- Demonstrates inter-service event flow

### 3. Add REST Controllers to Appointment Service
What's Missing:
- AppointmentController with POST /appointments, GET /appointments, PUT /appointments/{id}/reschedule
- PatientController with POST /patients, GET /patients
- Link to financial service via events

Template: cargo-tracker shows exact REST controller patterns

### 4. Implement Kafka Event Streaming
Components:
- Configure Spring Cloud Stream bindings
- Event publishers in each service
- Event listeners/consumers
- Demonstrate: Appointment Complete → Financial Invoice Created → Medical Record Updated

Template: cargo-tracker shows Kafka setup and event flow

### 5. Implement 2 Stream Processing Use Cases
Option 1: Real-time Appointment Analytics
- Stream: appointment-events topic
- Query: Count appointments per hour by type (windowed aggregation)
- REST endpoint: GET /analytics/appointments-per-hour

Option 2: Real-time Financial Claims Analytics
- Stream: financial-events topic
- Query: Insurance claims per 30-second window by status
- REST endpoint: GET /analytics/insurance-claims

Template: cargo-tracker-stream-processing shows EXACT implementation

### 6. Implement 2 Agentic AI Use Cases
Option 1: Appointment Scheduling Assistant
- LangChain4j agent with session memory
- Tools: checkAvailability, bookAppointment, rescheduleAppointment
- REST endpoint: GET /ai/appointment-assistant?sessionId=X&message=Y
- Template: customer-support-agent shows EXACT pattern

Option 2: Medication Interaction Checker
- LangChain4j agent for drug safety
- Tools: checkDrugInteractions, getMedicationInfo
- REST endpoint: GET /ai/medication-checker?sessionId=X&message=Y

===============================================================================
SIMPLIFICATION STRATEGY - AVOID OVER-ENGINEERING
===============================================================================

What NOT to Do:
- Don't build full frontend (not required)
- Don't implement complex security (not in requirements)
- Don't add extra microservices beyond 4
- Don't implement features beyond the 10 functional requirements
- Don't spend time on deployment/DevOps (local only)

What to Keep Simple:
- H2 in-memory databases (no PostgreSQL needed)
- Basic domain models (just enough for DDD patterns)
- Simple REST APIs (just CRUD + required business logic)
- Minimal AI tools (2-3 tools per agent is enough)
- Basic stream queries (simple windowed counts)

What Must Be Complete:
- 4 microservices running
- Kafka event flow demonstrated
- 2 stream processing queries working
- 2 AI agents responding
- All patterns from requirements visible in code
