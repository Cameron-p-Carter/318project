# Healthcare Platform - Status Update

## üéâ WHAT WE HAVE WORKING

### ‚úÖ All 4 Microservices Complete (Core Architecture)

**1. Appointment Service** (Port 8081)
- ‚úÖ Domain: Patient, Appointment entities with DDD patterns
- ‚úÖ 5 Domain events (PatientRegistered, AppointmentScheduled, etc.)
- ‚úÖ REST API: 7 endpoints for patient/appointment management
- ‚úÖ **Kafka Event Publishing** - Publishes all events to Kafka topics
- ‚úÖ H2 Database with sample data
- ‚úÖ Layered architecture (domain, service, controller, infrastructure)

**2. Financial Service** (Port 8084) - James
- ‚úÖ Invoice entity and management
- ‚úÖ REST API + CLI interface
- ‚úÖ **Kafka Event Listener** - Listens to appointment events
- ‚úÖ **Auto-creates invoices** when appointments are completed!
- ‚úÖ Insurance claims and payment tracking
- ‚úÖ Event publisher/listener infrastructure

**3. Medication Service** (Port 8082)
- ‚úÖ Prescription entity with DDD patterns
- ‚úÖ 3 Domain events (PrescriptionCreated, Refilled, Cancelled)
- ‚úÖ REST API: 6 endpoints for prescription management
- ‚úÖ Refill tracking system
- ‚úÖ H2 Database with sample data

**4. Medical Records Service** (Port 8083)
- ‚úÖ MedicalRecord aggregate root
- ‚úÖ 3 Domain events (RecordCreated, DiagnosisAdded, TreatmentAdded)
- ‚úÖ REST API: 7 endpoints for records, diagnoses, treatments
- ‚úÖ Patient history tracking
- ‚úÖ H2 Database with sample data

### ‚úÖ Event-Driven Architecture Working!

**Event Flow Demonstration:**
```
Appointment Completed Event
        ‚Üì
   Kafka Topic: appointment-events
        ‚Üì
Financial Service Listener
        ‚Üì
Auto-Create Invoice
```

**To See It In Action:**
1. Start Kafka (Zookeeper + Kafka server)
2. Start all 4 services
3. Complete an appointment: `PUT /api/appointments/{id}/complete`
4. Check financial service console - see auto-created invoice!
5. Verify: `GET /api/invoices` shows new invoice

## üîÑ WHAT'S NEXT - Required for Full Marks

### Priority 1: Stream Processing (REQUIRED - 2 use cases)
**Status**: Not started
**Requirement**: Real-time analytics using windowed queries
**Template Available**: cargo-tracker-0.1-stream-processing

**Proposed Implementation:**
1. **Analytics Service** - New microservice on port 8085
2. **Use Case 1**: Real-time appointment analytics
   - Count appointments per hour by type (windowed aggregation)
   - REST endpoint: GET /analytics/appointments-per-hour
3. **Use Case 2**: Real-time financial claims analytics
   - Insurance claims per 30-second window
   - REST endpoint: GET /analytics/insurance-claims

**Effort**: ~4-5 hours (template shows exact implementation)

### Priority 2: AI Agents (REQUIRED - 2 use cases)
**Status**: Not started
**Requirement**: LangChain4j agentic AI components
**Template Available**: customer-support-agent-main

**Proposed Implementation:**
1. **Appointment Scheduling Assistant**
   - Natural language appointment booking
   - Session memory for conversations
   - Tools: checkAvailability, bookAppointment, rescheduleAppointment
   - REST endpoint: GET /ai/appointment-assistant
   - **Add to**: Appointment Service

2. **Medication Interaction Checker**
   - AI-powered drug safety checking
   - Tools: checkDrugInteractions, getMedicationInfo
   - REST endpoint: GET /ai/medication-checker
   - **Add to**: Medication Service

**Effort**: ~5-6 hours (template shows exact LangChain4j patterns)

### Priority 3: Additional Event Listeners
**Status**: Partial (1 of 3 done)
**Already Done**: Financial listens to Appointment ‚úÖ

**Still Needed:**
- Medical Records listens to Appointment events (add diagnosis after completion)
- Medication listens to Appointment events (link prescriptions)

**Effort**: ~2 hours

mvn -version

# Download Kafka if not already done
# https://kafka.apache.org/downloads

mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 5: Test Event Flow
```bash
# View all appointments
curl http://localhost:8081/api/appointments

# Complete appointment ID 1 (triggers event)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8081/api/appointments/1/complete

# Check financial service console - should see:
# "Financial Service received event: ..."
# "‚úì Auto-created invoice for appointment: 1"

# Verify invoice created
curl http://localhost:8084/api/invoices
```

### Step 6: Run Test Script

# Mac/Linux
chmod +x test-services.sh
./test-services.sh
```

## üí° Key Insights

**What's Working Well:**
- Solid DDD foundation
- Clean microservice separation
- Kafka integration functioning
- Sample data makes testing easy

**What We Learned:**
- Event-driven architecture enables loose coupling
- Domain events naturally map to Kafka messages
- Layered architecture makes code maintainable
- Template projects are invaluable (cargo-tracker, customer-support-agent)

**Critical Path:**
1. Add stream processing (blocks 2 requirements)
2. Add AI agents (blocks 2 requirements)
3. Polish documentation
4. Practice demonstration

The foundation is solid - we're ~65% complete toward full marks!
